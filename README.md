This project was an implementation of a slightly modified VGG16 in order to classify x-ray images as either pneumonia or normal.
the dataset used is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia


VGG16 Model

to run the VGG16 code, make sure you have a kaggle api token named "kaggle.json"

to download your kaggle api token, make sure you have a kaggle account first

then follow the instructions in https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api under the authentication section

once you have your kaggle.json file, upload it to the code when prompted upload file and the dataset should get downloaded and unzipped

*note* when visualizing the new model's data, make sure to edit the number of epochs to the number which the second model ended at
