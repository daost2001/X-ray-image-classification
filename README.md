This project shows implementations of different ML models in order to classify x-ray images as either pneumonia or normal.
the dataset used is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia


VGG16 Model

to run the VGG16 code, make sure you have a kaggle api token named "kaggle.json"  
to download your kaggle api token, make sure you have a kaggle account first  
then follow the instructions in https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api under the authentication section  
once you have your kaggle.json file, upload it to the code when prompted upload file and the dataset should get downloaded and unzipped  

*note* when running the code for the "visualizing new model data" section, make sure to edit the epochs if the model performed an early stop  



GoogLeNet Model 


To run the GoogLeNet code, make sure you have a kaggle api token named "kaggle.json"  
To download your kaggle api token, make sure you have a kaggle account first  
Follow the instructions in https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api under the authentication section  
Once you have your kaggle.json file, upload it to the code when prompted upload file and the dataset should get downloaded and unzipped
